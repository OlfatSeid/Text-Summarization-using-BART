# Text Summarization Notebook

## Overview

This notebook provides a comprehensive solution for text summarization using the BART Large Language Model (LLM).
It includes functionality for extracting text from PDF files, generating embeddings,
performing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and displaying the output using the `ipywidgets` library.

## Features

- **Text Extraction from PDF**: Extracts text content from PDF files.
- **Embeddings**: Generates embeddings for the extracted text using a pre-trained model.
- **BART Model for Summarization**: Utilizes the BART model for generating summaries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances summarization by incorporating relevant retrieved documents.
- **Interactive UI**: Uses the `ipywidgets` library for an interactive user interface to display the summarization results.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install torch transformers PyMuPDF ipywidgets sentence-transformers

## Notebook Sections
1. Setup and Imports
This section includes all necessary imports and setup for the notebook.

2. PDF Text Extraction
Code to read and extract text from PDF files using PyMuPDF.

3. Embeddings Generation
Uses a pre-trained sentence-transformer model to generate embeddings for the extracted text.

4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Enhances the summarization process by retrieving relevant documents and incorporating their content.
5. Fine-Tuning BART
Fine-tunes the BART model on a specific dataset to improve summarization performance. This section covers:

Preparing the dataset for fine-tuning.
Setting up the fine-tuning environment.
Running the fine-tuning process.
Evaluating the fine-tuned model.

6. Interactive UI
Use the provided UI to upload a PDF file. The notebook will extract text, generate embeddings, perform RAG, and display the summary in the UI.
